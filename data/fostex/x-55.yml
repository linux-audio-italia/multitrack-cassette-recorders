  description: >
    The Fostex X-26 is an entry level machine that uses the normal
    cassette speed and can record only on max two tracks at
    once. It's very light and small and inaugurates Fostex trend of
    using a single pot for two functions for saving space: a very
    clever move that condensates in a single pot two controls and a
    switch (it can be confusing at first). Here for example the aux
    sends on channels 3-6 send the input signal if you turn them
    before noon, and the track signal if you turn them past
    noon. Even if it's a basic machine it has individual track
    outputs and can produce decent recordings.
