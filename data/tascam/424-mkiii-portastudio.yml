  description: >
    This is the very last four track cassette recorder produced, and
    one of the most sought after for its features, which are quite
    comprehensive, and the very good audio specification. It has four
    XLR inputs for directly connecting dynamic mics (unfortunately
    there is no phantom power) and six complete mono channels with
    three band eq (with sweepable mids) and effect sends. It has also
    a stereo sub in that lets you connect an external mixer directly
    into the master bus.
