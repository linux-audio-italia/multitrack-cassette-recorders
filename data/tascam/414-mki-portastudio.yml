  description: >
    The Tascam 414 mk1 is a mid level recorder that offers good
    features in a small package: it has two aux busses, and one of
    them doubles as a cue monitor buss. It can record to four track
    at a time and the routing is quite flexible with its 8 mixer
    channels. It doesn't have individual track outputs, but you can
    use the aux busses and the sync out (which is a tape out for
    track 4) to get the four tape tracks signal separated.
