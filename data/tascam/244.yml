  description: >
    The Tascam 244 Portastudio is one of the most known and famous four track cassette recorders, and it's the direct heir of the very first Portastudio: the 144, which launched in 1979. It's big and heavy and features four big analog VU meters and two semi-parametric equalizers per channel. It runs only at double speed (9.5 cm/s) and uses a non-defeatable DBX noise reduction system.
