  description: >
    The first iteration of the succesful 424 line with the
    characteristic beige-box color of early personal computers has
    only a limited 2 band graphic equalization on each channel, but
    it's the only recorder that features the low speed of 2.4 cm/s
    (half the normal cassette playing speed), making it a favourite
    choice among the drone/ambient musicians.
