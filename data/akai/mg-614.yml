  description: >
    The Akai MG 614 is often described as the "Rolls Royce" of
    cassette 4 tracks, because it's built to a professional standard
    and has some features not found in any other recorder, like an
    hidden sync track that makes it able to sync to MIDI without
    sacrificing a track, or XLR sockets: a feature found only much
    later, and in very few models.
